# Standard content page

It's the most used content type. The Standard Content **allows editors to build a page by adding components or paragraphs**. 

Imagine the Standard Content as a blank page and the components or paragraphs as pieces of content that you as an editor, can put together or arrange in many ways.

The Standard content page comes with some pre charged features such as: _top links, menu, floating menu and footer -_ so editors can focus on content creation.

This is an example of a common Standard content page and how it has been built:

The red blocks are the **paragraphs** added to this page. These **paragraphs** can be formed by **components** or **items**. As an example, **Flipcard** is a paragraph composed by **4** **Flipcard** **Items \(content type\)** that are nested inside this paragraph. This means that you have to create first the content type named Flipcard and then create the Flipcard paragraph to view the items you've created.
