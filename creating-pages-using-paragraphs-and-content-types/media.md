### Paragraph review

**Node title / Hero banner:** allows us to display the title in a page. Title is a mandatory field that can be found on the left side of the form under the name Content. Scroll down to the Hero Zone, add a name for the title. In this case we have no background image so only the title is displayed. 

**Embedded Views Content**: this paragraph has a views content call News View Content to showcase a preview of the news by using the Featured News taxonomy. 

**Embedded Views Content:** in this case, the paragraph uses again the News View content but to showcase  Recent News view content. 

**Multiple columns:** as we can see on this templates, we have two blocks of columns. 8 value at the left and 4 value on the right, for a total of 12. Remember that the value for the total width is 12, so the column on the left is 2 times bigger than the one on the right. 

On the left we can see a Column Content nested on the Multiple Columns paragraph. At the same time, we're using a Embedded Views content with the category Events to have a view of the content. On the right, we use a Column Content to call a Embbeded Component with a Twitter timeline paragraph to display a twitter plugin inside the column.

In this section we find:

**Embedded Views content**: this paragraph allows us to nest a View content call Earned Media that will display a selection of the articles that we have previously created.  

**Logo Grid**: is a paragraph that allows Editors to display logos from clients, partners or different brands related. 

**Embedded Components**: with the paragraph we can create three-column-layout to work on 3 columns. 

The first column is using an Embedded Views content paragraph with a View content call Archive , the second one a Hero banner and the last one another Embedded Views content paragraph using the Views content called Categories.
