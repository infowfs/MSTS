_**First thing:** remember that **Standard content page** is the content type we use when creating a page. This content type allows Editors to **add paragraphs** that will create the page indeed._ 

### Paragraph review

**Hero area:** This is a feature that exists in the Standard content type. Hero banner is the first visual element a visitor encounters when opens the site or page. Hero is not a paragraph we add but a feature that Editors can use or not when creating the page. Hero area features a title, a description and a background image or solid color. 

**Flipcard**: is a paragraph that allows Editors to showcase the Flipcards items content type. This means that the paragraph is a wrap or a view but the content is actually pieces of Flipcard content type that have been previously created.

**Statistics:** this paragraph allows editors to create each one of the items that are displayed, including the icon, text and background. 

**Content quote:** //Content quote definition//
