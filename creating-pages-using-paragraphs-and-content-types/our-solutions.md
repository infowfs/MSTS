_**This page was created with the Standar Content page.** Remember that **Standard content page** is the content type we use for creating most of the pages. This content type allows Editors to **add paragraphs** that will create the page indeed._ 

### Paragraph review

**Hero area:** This is a feature that exists in the Standard content type. Hero banner is the first visual element a visitor encounters when opens the site or page. Hero is not a paragraph we add but a feature that Editors can use or not when creating the page. Hero area features a title, a description and a background image or solid color. **In this case, the Editors decided to use a title only without background image.** 

**Info blocks:** this paragraph allows Editors to create an element mixing CTA, text content and media files within the same paragraph. In this case, the editors created the paragraph by using content, an URL to showcase a video and a CTA. These options are fully customizable at the moment you create the paragraph. 

**Flipcard**: is a paragraph that allows Editors to showcase the Flipcards items content type. This means that the paragraph is a wrap or a view but the content is actually pieces of Flipcard content type that have been previously created.
