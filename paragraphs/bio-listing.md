This paragraph is a wrap. This means that it's a paragraph that works as a viewer to display pieces of content that were previously created. The content you get to see in the paragraph was created using the [Corporate Bio content type](../content-types-1/corporate-bio.md). Bio listing takes the profiles or bio created and wrap them together in a specific layout. 

The default display is 5 profiles per page. The others will be accesible by horizontal scrolling.
