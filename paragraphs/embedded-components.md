# Embedded components

**Embeddable components** allow Editors to showcase pieces of content created with the [**Embeddable content**](../content-types-1/embedded-content.md). The paragraph has a **three-column-layout** to display 3 items in a row per default.

2. **Paragraph type**: this is the option that allows Editors to choose the paragraph view.

### Paragraph type available in Embedded components:

You can choose from: 

**Embedded views content**

Displays a list of Views content that you have already created using [Embeddable content](../content-types-1/embedded-content.md). What the Embedded view does is to take one of the categories you created and showcase its content. 

So, to resume: the paragraph Embedded Components is a wrap where you nest a Paragraph type to display the content. If you select the Embedded Views content, we'll get to see the categories and their content that you previously created.
